# My Logbook Visualized: Project Overview 
* Objective: To produce simple graphs that give  insight on the pilot's career based on their logbooks.
* Method: Created a python script that can take the standardized digital logbook issued by Cathay Pacific Group and generate standard graphs for all pilots.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.9.1 
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, dateutil

## Importing the data
* The logbook is given in a .txt format. The easiest method to convert the .txt to csv is to import it using Excel and add External Data. Pandas does have a read_fwf function but the output was not in a clean format.

## Data Cleaning
* The columns were quite clean as this was a computer generated file and flight records were complete. I split the city pairs into origin and destination for easier analysis. The date/time of flight was changed into datetime dtype using pandas.to_datetime.

## EDA
* Below are the highlights from the logbook visualization. Personal names are encrypted for privacy.
